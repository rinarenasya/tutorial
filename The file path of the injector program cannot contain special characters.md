# The file path of the injector program cannot contain special characters
### You might face this error for various reasons.
You can follow the next steps:
- Make sure that your Korepi folder doesn't contain any symbols or non-English characters. Ex: `v1.2.1.0_fix1` change it to `v1.2.1.0fix1`.
- If it's still giving error, make sure that your path doesn't contain any special characters too. Ex: `C:\windows\example\Desktop\test_sa\Korepi` change to `C:\windows\example\Desktop\testsa\Korepi`.

# The game path cannot contain special characters.
Almost the same as previous error:
- Check your game path, if your game is installed on `Program Files (x86)` this error might occur.
- Change your game installation so somewhere without any special characters.
- Example. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Genshin Impact\Genshin Impact game` to `C:\Program Files\Genshin Impact\Genshin Impact game`
